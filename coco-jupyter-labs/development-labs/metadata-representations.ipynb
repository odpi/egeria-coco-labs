    "Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information (called metadata) about data and the technology that supports it.\n",

    "As part of the huge business transformation that Coco Pharmaceuticals has embarked on, they\n",

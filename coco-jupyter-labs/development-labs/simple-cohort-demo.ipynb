    "# Welcome to the Simple Cohort Demo Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Egeria is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information (called metadata) about data and the technology that supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab you will set up four open metadata servers and connect them together via an [Open Metadata Repository Cohort](https://egeria-project.org/features/cohort-operation/overview/) (or cohort for short).  Then issue different types of requests to retrieve and update metadata.  The aim is to demonstrate how the cohort works and explore the business value of this capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Egeria team use the personas and scenarios from the fictitious company called [Coco Pharmaceuticals](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/).\n",
    "As part of the huge business transformation that Coco Pharmaceuticals has embarked on, they\n",
    "have decided to use Egeria to manage their metadata across the enterprise.\n",

    "[Polly Tasker](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/polly-tasker/),\n",
    "the lead of IT development asked [Peter Profile](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/peter-profile/) and [Erin Overview](https://egeria-project.org/practices/coco-pharmaceuticals/personas/erin-overview/) from the governance team to give a series of talks and a demos about Egeria to her team, who will be building integration code to connect various tools and applications into Egeria.\n",

    "Coco Pharamaceuticals has always been pretty open to allowing their teams to choose how they work.  The result is that the different teams have their own tools deployed with little commonality or integration.  There is also variation in the level of governance that is in place.  The teams that report to their regulators have their specific processes, but other teams rarely think about monitoring and improving their processes or how they can work more effectively across the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed shift to personalized medicine requires faster cycle times and greater collaboration between teams.  Egeria's role is to help them in both aspects.  Peter and Erin plan to use this session to show how Egeria can connect different tools together to share information and add governance capabilities over and above the support they provide.\n",
